# Server Startup Troubleshooting Guide

This document outlines the diagnosis and resolution steps for a critical failure where both the backend and frontend servers would not start.

---

### 1. The Problem: What was the issue?

There were two independent problems that prevented the application from running:

1.  **Backend Failure:** The Python-based backend server would crash immediately upon trying to start.
2.  **Frontend Failure:** The JavaScript-based frontend was unable to install its necessary packages due to a corrupted dependency folder (`node_modules`), which also prevented it from starting.

---

### 2. The Cause: Why did it happen?

The issues stemmed from a mismatch between the project's requirements and the local computer's configuration.

*   **Cause of the Backend Failure (Environment Mismatch):**
    The project's code was developed using modern Python syntax (features introduced in Python 3.8+). However, the local machine's default Python version was **3.7.4**. This incompatibility caused a `SyntaxError` when the server tried to load its dependencies, leading to the crash. This is a common issue when moving a project between different computers that don't have perfectly aligned development environments.

*   **Cause of the Frontend Failure (Dependency Corruption):**
    The frontend's dependency folder (`node_modules`) had developed incorrect file permissions. This can happen over time if `npm` commands are interrupted or due to other system-level operations. These permission errors prevented the normal tools (`rm`, `npm install`) from being able to clean up and reinstall the packages correctly, leaving it in a broken state.

### 3. The Solution: What did we do to fix it?

We followed a systematic, three-phase approach:

1.  **Phase 1: Triage & Cleanup:**
    *   All lingering server and installation processes were terminated to ensure a clean, predictable state for diagnosis.

2.  **Phase 2: Systematic Diagnosis:**
    *   **Backend:** An attempt to run the server in isolation captured the exact `SyntaxError`, confirming the Python version incompatibility as the root cause.
    *   **Frontend:** Attempts to reinstall dependencies failed with permission errors, confirming the `node_modules` directory was corrupted.

3.  **Phase 3: Coordinated Resolution:**
    *   **Fixed the Backend:** A modern version of Python (**3.11.13**) was installed and configured for the project. A fresh virtual environment was created, and all backend dependencies were reinstalled using this new, compatible Python version.
    *   **Fixed the Frontend:** The corrupted `node_modules` directory was forcefully removed (bypassing the permission errors), and a clean `npm install` was executed to rebuild the dependencies from scratch.

Following these steps, both servers were successfully started and verified as fully operational.
