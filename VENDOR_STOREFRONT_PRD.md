### 1.3 Success Metrics
- Increased time spent on vendor pages (target: 3x current vendor detail modal engagement)
- Higher order conversion rates from storefront visits (target: 25% improvement)
- Increased average order value through enhanced product discovery (target: 15% improvement)
- Improved vendor satisfaction scores through enhanced self-service capabilities
- Reduced support tickets related to vendor information and product inquiries
